## Results

### Desired Symmetric Heat Profile

The assumed initial heat profile for the 8x5 grid configuration

The final heat profile, actuator precision, and sensor precision values obtained using the developed design framework **when actuators and sensors were placed at each location** on the grid.

The final heat profile, actuator precision, and sensor precision values obtained using the developed design framework **when actuators and sensors were placed along the wall**.

The temperature evolution profile for the selected grid points. The plots show the evolution of the 1000 trajectories with a given initial uncertainty in the temperature and reduce the final uncertainty/variation in the temperature.
